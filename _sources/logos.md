# Logos

Our logo is the visual cornerstone of the Vermont Data Science Group brand. It should be used consistently across all communications.

## Primary Logo

The primary logo is our main brand identifier and should be used in most applications.

### Logo Variations

We offer several logo variations to accommodate different use cases:

- **Full Color Logo**: Use this version whenever possible
- **Single Color Logo**: For situations where full color reproduction is not possible
- **White Logo**: For use on dark backgrounds
- **Black Logo**: For use on light backgrounds

## Clear Space

Always maintain adequate clear space around the logo to ensure visibility and impact. The minimum clear space should be equal to the height of the "V" in the logo on all sides.

## Minimum Size

To maintain legibility, never reproduce the logo smaller than:
- **Print**: 0.5 inches wide
- **Digital**: 72 pixels wide

## What Not to Do

❌ Do not stretch or distort the logo
❌ Do not change the logo colors
❌ Do not rotate the logo
❌ Do not add effects (shadows, gradients, etc.)
❌ Do not place the logo on busy backgrounds

## Logo Downloads

*Logo files will be available in various formats (PNG, SVG, EPS) for different use cases.*
